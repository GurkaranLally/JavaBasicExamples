ASSIGNMENTS ON STRING AND ARRAYS.

========================
STRING ASSIGNMENT
========================


A. The string has a s.toCharArray() method that can be used for converting string
to a character array. Example snippet below.

  String s = "GeeksforGeeks"; 
        char[] gfg = s.toCharArray(); 
        for (int i = 0; i < gfg.length; i++) { 
            System.out.println(gfg[i]); 
        }

B. String has a split() method that allows you to split a string in to an array of strings.

3. Count the number of words in a sentence?
4. Remove extra white spaces in a sentence.



===============================
ARRAY ASSIGNMENT
===============================

1. Remove duplicate elements in an integer array
2. Find largest and second largest number in an integer array
3. Sort the elements in an array in ascending order.
